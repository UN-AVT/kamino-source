518894,136769,Pipistrellus murrayi,Extinct,2017,"<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">This species is listed as Extinct. There has been extensive survey work for, and monitoring of, this species over recent decades which has documented a dramatic population decline from previously being common and widespread across Christmas Island. It was listed as Critically Endangered in 2006 after a decline in excess of 90% in three generations (12–15 years) based on an index of relative abundance from bat detectors, and subsequently by direct observation of the remaining individuals at a single roost. In January 2009, the total known adult population was four individuals and the estimated population was considered to be fewer than 20 individuals. By August 2009, only one remaining individual was found during an extensive survey, which was recorded consistently each day in its foraging and roosting areas. This individual disappeared on 27 August 2009 and no individuals have been located since, despite extensive searching using proven techniques.&#160;</p>","<p><em>Pipistrellus murrayi</em> roosted under bark, in dead foliage, and in tree hollows. Maternity roosts were discovered in late 2005 under shedding bark of dead forest trees (<em>Tristiropsis acutangula</em> and <em>Inocarpus fagifer</em>), many of which were heavily decayed and collapsed soon after (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). Females formed colonies of up to approximately 50 individuals, while males often roosted solitarily (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2007). Generation length of this species was likely to be 4-5 years. This species roosted in mature, tropical, evergreen, closed canopy rainforests and mature, tropical, semi-deciduous rainforests (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 1999, James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). It foraged in and over these forests and also along tracks, and in and over secondary forests and thickets of woody weeds (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 1999, James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). It fed on a range of small flying invertebrates, predominantly moths, beetles, and flying ants (Lumsden and Schulz 2009).<br/></p>","<p>The reasons for the decline and ultimate extinction of <em>P. murrayi</em> remain unclear. While habitat loss may have caused some declines in the past, 75% of Christmas Island is covered by primary or secondary rainforest, with little change in the amount of available habitat during the period of decline. Furthermore, most of the species’ range was within a National Park. The major threats to the species may have included predation or disturbance to bats within their roosts from introduced species, e.g. Common Wolf Snake (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>), Feral Cat (<em>Felis catus</em>), Black Rat (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) and Giant Centipede (<em>Scolopendra subspinipes</em>) (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). Although not considered the primary cause of decline, as the spatio-temporal pattern did not closely match the pipistrelle’s decline, a series of recent population explosions of Yellow Crazy Ants (<em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em>) is likely to have led to some habitat change, likely decline in invertebrate prey resources, and may also have disturbed individuals at roost sites. It is also possible that some disease may have contributed to the decline, however, individuals captured over the period of decline appeared to be in good health, with the exception of low white blood cell counts, although the significance of these findings was unclear (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). Even the last known individual appeared to behave normally before it vanished.<br/></p>","Because <em>Pipistrellus murrayi</em> was the only echolocating bat on Christmas Island, ultrasonic bat detectors were an effective technique for documenting its status, as it was readily recorded and could not be confused with, or obscured by, other species. Intensive detector sampling over many years (intermittent between the mid-1990s and 2004, and then almost continuous until and after its extinction) has provided an unusually detailed documentation of its decline, resulting in it being one of the most intensely monitored bat species on the planet.<br/><br/>Although there were no reliable population estimates, <em>P. murrayi</em> was reported to be abundant and widespread across Christmas Island at the time of its first settlement (1890s) (Andrews 1900), and was still abundant and widespread at the time of the first substantial study of it in 1984 (Tidemann 1985). By 1994 its range had contracted away from the north-east section of the island (which is where the only town is located), its distribution had become patchy, and it had started to decline in abundance (Lumsden and Cherry 1997). Between 1994 and 1998 there was a further westward range contraction and an apparent mean reduction of 33% in relative abundance, although this was not statistically significant (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 1999, Schulz and Lumsden 2004). Between 1998 and 2004 there was a decline of between 55 and 65% in relative abundance and a continuing westward contraction of range of about 25 to 50% (James 2005). This decline continued and the species was then (<em>ca</em> 2007) considered to be confined to the far west of the island, no longer occurring across more than 90% of its former range (James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). Long-term monitoring using bat detectors indicated this species underwent a 90% decline in abundance between 1994 and 2006 (James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). This decline continued at a severe and consistent rate with the species disappearing from many of the few remaining sites where it was present in 2006 (Parks Australia North Christmas Island unpub. data).<br/><br/>In December 2008, the remaining <em>P. murrayi</em> population was thought to be restricted to a single foraging area and a single roost area (Lumsden and Schulz 2009). Although the remaining single known roost site had previously contained as many as 50 individuals, by January 2009 there were only four adults present. The behaviour of these individuals suggested that they were lactating females with four dependent young in the roost. The total population was then estimated to be fewer than 20 individuals in order to account for the possibility of small undetected colonies (Lumsden and Schulz 2009). Lumsden and Schulz (2009) stated that the January findings indicated that without urgent intervention there was an extremely high risk that the species would become extinct in the near future. While it could not be precisely predicted when this would occur if there was no intervention, it was predicted that this could occur within the following six months.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this predicted extinction of the species was realised. After the January findings, approval was urgently sought to capture the remaining individuals for a captive breeding program, the details of which had been outlined in a feasibility report (Lumsden and Schulz 2009). Rather than acting immediately the Australian government established an Expert Working Group, and waited for its report in July 2009 (Beeton <em>et al</em>. 2009) before approving this intervention. In August 2009, a team of bat experts and captive breeding specialists attempted to take the remaining individuals into captivity. During the four weeks of intensive sampling, which employed 30 bat detectors each night to document the location of the remaining individuals, only one individual could be found, and despite extensive trapping efforts using standard and innovative techniques, it evaded all attempts to catch it (Lumsden 2009). On 27 August 2009 this individual also disappeared, and all survey and trapping attempts since that night have failed to detect the species. This is one of the few times that an extinction of a species in the wild can be marked to the day. The failure of the responsible agencies and managers to act quickly in response to the evidence of the rapid population decline is considered to have contributed to the extinction of this species (Lunney <em>et al</em>. 2011, Martin <em>et al</em>. 2012).",,"<span lang=""EN-AU"">This species was endemic to Christmas Island (<span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU"">approximately 135 km² in area), <span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU"">Australia, which is in the eastern Indian Ocean.

Irrespective, the lowland and slope forests of Rarotonga, and especially those in the vicinity of Avarua and Arorangi are amongst the most heavily modified on the island as a result of deforestation for agriculture, roading, housing and plantation forestry.

The species appears to have preferred swamps and swamp forests, such as river valleys, river deltas, and bogs, but it probably also lived in drier forests, and perhaps in open parkland (The Extinction Website, 2007). In Europe, there might have been an ecological separation between the preferred habitat of the aurochs and that of the European bison (<em>Bison bonasus</em>), with the aurochs lived in somewhat wetter forests and the European bison in the somewhat drier forests (The Extinction Website, 2007), though the niches of these two species almost certainly overlapped (Van Vuure, 2003).","In central Poland in the forests of the village of Jaktorów for several centuries the managed of the remaining aurochs was well organised (The Extinction Website, 2007). Initially the animals were owned by nobility, but later they became royal possessions (The Extinction Website, 2007). There they were protected and fed during the winter period (The Extinction Website, 2007). However, the Kings Zygmunt I and his successor Zygmunt August had less interest than their predecessors and did little to preserve the animals, and the conservation measures weakened (The Extinction Website, 2007). After 1572, a period of political turmoil lead to a decrease in influence of the King. By 1604 only a few aurochs remained, and a Royal decree was issued stating that everything needed to be done to protect the aurochs and its habitat, but this was not enough (Van Vuure, 2003). The species disappeared because of hunting and competition on its feeding grounds with domesticated cattle (The Extinction Website, 2007). The last aurochs in Poland disappeared through a combination of lack of interest, corruption, cattle diseases, food competition (from domesticated cattle), and to a lesser extent, hunting (Van Vuure, 2003).","The right to hunt large animals on any land was restricted to nobles and gradually to the royal household (The Extinction Website, 2007). As the population of aurochs declined, hunting ceased but the royal court still required gamekeepers to provide open fields for the aurochs to graze in (The Extinction Website, 2007). The gamekeepers were exempted from local taxes in exchange for their service and a decree made poaching an aurochs punishable by death (The Extinction Website, 2007), but this was not enough to save the species. In 1564, the gamekeepers knew of only 38 animals, according to the royal survey (The Extinction Website, 2007).

The aurochs had three subspecies: <em>Bos primigenius primigenius</em> from Europe and the Middle East; <em>B. p. namadicus</em> from India; and <em>B. p. mauretanicus</em> from North Africa. Only the nominate subspecies has survived until recent times. Originally the aurochs occurred from the British Isles and southern Scandinavia, through most of Europe to northern Africa, the Middle East, central Asia and India. By the 13th century A.D., the aurochs' range was restricted to Poland, Lithuania, Moldova, Transylvania and East Prussia (The Extinction Website, 2007).

The island is a relatively flat shelf of pot-holed, karstic dolomite covered by sparse, shrubby vegetation (largely the result of 19th century mining operations) with a second, higher plateau with apparently natural savannas as well as areas cleared during the mining operations, interspersed with dense but stunted woodland dominated by four tree species: Short Leaf Fig (<em>Ficus populnea </em>var. <em>brevifolia</em>)<em>, </em>False Mastic (<em>Sideroxylon foetidissimum</em>)<em>, </em>Pigeon Plum (<em>Coccoloba diversifolia</em>)<em>, </em>and Poisonwood (<em>Metopium brownei</em>). Although iguanas probably occurred island-wide prior to their extinction, preferred habitat almost certainly consisted of rocky areas and savannas instead of the densely forested portions of the island. Because Navassa lacks beaches, nesting presumably occurred in pockets of mineralized phosphate that accumulated in potholes. The phosphate (which was commercially extracted during the period when the iguanas presumably became extinct) might have been either of marine or terrestrial origin: precipitates of seawater during periods of submergence or from fish digested by birds and deposited as guano, respectively.<br/><br/>Among the five specimens&#160;known for this iguana, the maximum snout-vent length is 42 cm for the largest male and 37.8 cm snout-vent length for the largest female (Powell 2000). Based on the morphology of similar species, this is probably far less than the maximum for this iguana.","Like other rock iguanas, the Navassa Rhinoceros Iguana was probably threatened by non-native predators, hunting for human consumption, and non-native competitors which destroyed the vegetation.

These streams are mostly perennial, but in extremely dry years they may cease to flow (Ingram 1983). The vegetation along the stream banks is usually closed forest or tall closed forest with emergent eucalypts, although there are some sites in open forest with grassy ground cover (Ingram 1983). In spring and summer individuals were usually found in or at the edge of rock pools, either amongst leaf-litter, under and between stones or in crevices around the edge (Ingram 1983). The species was also found under rock in shallow water in backwaters and also the main flow of permanent watercourses (Ingram 1983; Czechura 1991). Searches of popular sites in winter only recovered two frogs and it is assumed that the species hibernates in deep crevices in rocks or spaces between rocks underwater during the colder months (Ingram 1983). Adult males tend to prefer deeper pools, whereas females and juveniles may move to newly created pools after rain as long as these pools contained stones and/or leaf-litter (Ingram 1983). The prerequisite for the use of pools by this species seems to be that the pool must be deep enough for the frog to be able to sit with its head out of the water and be able to safely submerge (Ingram 1983). Individuals will only sit fully exposed on the rocks during light rain (Ingram 1983). <em>Rheobatrachus silus</em> has never been recorded from cleared riparian habitat. Breeding activity occurs between October and December (Ingram 1983). Males call from rock crevices above pools (Ingram 1983). Females brood young within the stomach and give birth through the mouth (Tyler and Carter 1982). Fertilized eggs or early stage larvae are presumably swallowed by the female and complete their development in the stomach (Tyler and Carter 1982). The number of eggs in gravid females (approximately 40) exceeds the number of juveniles found to occur in the stomach (21-26) (Tyler 1989). It is not known whether or not the excess eggs are digested by the female or whether or not they are simply not swallowed (Tyler 1989). The production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of the female ceases during brooding (Tyler <em>et al.</em> 1983). Tadpoles develop in a manner similar to the aquatic tadpoles of other species though, as they feed off egg yolk, the labial teeth are absent and the intestines form at a later stage of development (Tyler 1989). After 6-7 weeks the females give birth to up to 25 young (Tyler and Davies 1983a). Young emerge from the female’s mouth as fully formed frogs and after four days the digestive tract returns to normal and the female recommences feeding (Tyler and Davies 1983b). Ingram (1983) reported minimum brooding periods from two individuals of 36 and 43 days and suggested that the duration was such that females were unlikely to breed twice in one season.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown (Tyler and Davies 1985b). Populations were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. Although the species persisted in the streams during these activities, the effects of timber harvesting on this aquatic species were never investigated. Its habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weeds (especially mistflower <em>Ageratina riparia</em>), and altered flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). However, from what is known from similar declines and disappearances elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis must be suspected.","The species declined rapidly and disappeared at about the same time as a sympatric species <em>Taudactylus diurnus</em> (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Czechura and Ingram (1990) and Ingram (1990) state that the last frog was seen in the wild in 1979 on the Conondale Range. However, Richards, McDonald and Alford (1993) reported the existence of a specimen taken from the Blackall Range in 1981. Despite intensive searching, the species has not been located since (Ingram and McDonald 1993; Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). In the laboratory, the last known individual died in 1983 (Tyler and Davies 1985b). Ingram (1983) studied a population of the species in the headwaters of Booloumba Creek, Conondale Range, and estimated that approximately 78 were present in 1976. No other estimates of population size are available for the species. This species is now believed to be extinct.",,"This species, an Australian endemic, was restricted to elevations between 350 and 800m asl in the Blackall and Conondale Ranges in south-east Queensland (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). The geographic distribution of the species was less than 1,400km² (map in Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). <em>Rheobatrachus silus</em> inhabited streams in the catchments of the Mary, Stanley and Mooloolah River (Ingram 1983).

8897826,19476,Rheobatrachus vitellinus,Extinct,2004,"Listed as Extinct because it has not been recorded in the wild since 1985, and extensive searches over the last 20 years have failed to locate this species.","It is an aquatic species largely restricted to the shallow section of fast-flowing creeks and streams in rainforest. It is one of only two known species to brood its offspring within its stomach. Females deposited their eggs, and then swallowed them. While in the stomach, tadpoles excreted some form of enzyme that inhibited the female's gastric digestion, and then proceded to develop into fully formed froglets. The froglets were then regurgitated through the female's mouth.","The cause(s) of the population decline remain unknown. McDonald (1990) found no obvious evidence that seasonal rarity, over-collecting, predation, drought, floods, habitat destruction, disease, heavy parasite loads or stress due to handling for data collection were responsible for the population declines. Threats to the Eungella National Park include fires that might sweep up the slopes of the mountain during harvesting of the sugar cane in the fields below (Winter and McDonald 1986). Successive fires extend deeper into the rainforest leaving grassy ridges that are devoid of trees (Winter and McDonald 1986). The rainforest is extremely narrow in places and continual fire might eventually erode away entire sections of the forest or fragment the forest (Winter and McDonald 1986). Weeds that encroach on the edges of the forest pose a similar threat (Winter and McDonald 1986). It was thought that it might have been possible that the decline that was observed in 1984-1985 was a natural population fluctuation and that residual individuals had retreated to hidden refuges (Winter and McDonald 1986; McDonald 1990). The extent of such population fluctuations is unknown, but there is evidence of large swings in numbers of other Australian frogs (McDonald 1990). However, despite continued efforts to locate the species, it has not been recorded within Eungella National Park or any other locations since March 1985 (Ingram and McDonald 1993; Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993; Hero <em>et al.</em> 1998, 2002; McDonald and Alford 1999). Eungella National Park is subject to weed invasion on the edges of the reserve (Winter and McDonald 1986). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, chytridiomycosis (present in at least some rainforest streams at Eungella) must be suspected and a major causes of the extinction of this species.","The species was considered common across its range until January 1985 when the first signs of decline (reported by Winter and McDonald 1986) were observed at lower altitudes (i.e., about 400m asl) (McDonald 1990).

9129524,199838,Pennatomys nivalis,Extinct,2011,"The Nevis Rice Rat has never been definitely reported extant during the European historical period. However, it is known to have survived until almost immediately prior to European arrival in the Caribbean, suggesting strongly that pre-Columbian human impacts did not cause its disappearance and that it persisted into the historical period. Several reports of rats being eaten on Nevis and St. Kitts, in one instance of animals specifically described as “unusual-looking” (i.e. suggesting a difference from introduced black rats), have been reported from the seventeenth, eighteenth, and twentieth centuries, until the 1930s, and may well represent this species. However, several weeks of survey work in 2009 (involving live trapping with Sherman and Tomahawk traps) at various elevations in the forests of Nevis Peak found no evidence of the Nevis Rice Rat’s continued survival, and instead discovered very high densities of invasive mongoose and black rats throughout the island’s forests (Turvey unpublished data). The species is therefore assessed as Extinct.","Nothing is known about this species’ habitat or ecology. This island rice rat was about the same size as a black rat, and therefore much smaller than <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Megalomys</span>, the other recently extinct endemic insular Caribbean rice rat genus.","The cause of extinction of the Nevis Rice Rat is unknown. However, its survival until the European historical era suggests that its extinction may have been driven by predation or competition with invasive mammals, probably introduced black rats or mongoose.",This species is now extinct.,,"The Nevis Rice Rat formerly occurred on the three main islands of the Saint Kitts Bank (Nevis, Saint Kitts and Saint Eustatius). It has been recorded from numerous pre-Columbian zooarchaeological sites, as it constituted a major component of the diet of prehistoric Amerindians.","This species was widely exploited by Amerindians for food during the recent prehistoric period, but its continued presence in kitchen middens dating closely before European arrival in the Caribbean c.500 years ago suggests that this exploitation did not seriously impact its population. Animals specifically identified as rats, and therefore possibly representing this species, were described as providing “good meat” on St. Kitts (Harlow 1925), and in 1720 it was reported that “in Nevis some people do eat Rats, wrapping them up in banano-leaves to bake them as it were under warm embers” (Merrill 1958).

In addition, animals were also found along watercourses in pure stands of the palm <em>Archontophoenix cunninghamia</em>, in exposed areas, in gorges, in dense non-forest riparian vegetation (<em>Lomandra longifolia</em>, <em>Carex neuroclamys</em>, <em>Elastostema reticulatum</em> and <em>Blechnum nudum</em>) and where the riparian vegetation had been slightly infested with <em>Lantana camara</em> (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Permanent streams with rocky substrates were favoured, but this species also occurred in permanent and ephemeral streams on gravel, clay, sand and soil substrates (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Active frogs have been observed all year round, although less frequently during winter months (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Breeding occurred in warm weather after or during heavy rain from late October to May, with a January to March peak (Czechura and Ingram 1990; Meyer, Hines and Hero 2001d). Gravid females have been reported between November and May (Straughan and Lee 1966). Amplexus is inguinal and 24-36 eggs (2.2mm diameter) are deposited in gelatinous clumps under rocks or branches in the water (Liem and Hosmer 1973; Watson and Martin 1973; Czechura and Ingram 1990; Meyer, Hines and Hero 2001d). Tadpoles, illustrated by Liem and Hosmer (1973) and Watson and Martin (1973), were found throughout the year.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown. Like <em>Rheobatrachus silus</em>, logging has occurred in catchments occupied by the species (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999); however, the effect of timber harvesting on the species has not been investigated. The species’ habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weed species (especially mist flower) and altered stream flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). <em>Taudactylus diurnus</em> was not found in areas along watercourses that were heavily infested with <em>Lantana camara</em> or where the weeds <em>Baccharis halimifilia</em> and <em>Agertina riparia</em> (mist flower) occurred (Czechura and Ingram 1990). The frogs were also absent from streams with very muddy water associated with the activities of feral pigs (Czechura and Ingram 1990). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis also must be suspected as a cause for the decline.","In the early 1970s it was considered to be relatively common (McEvoy, McDonald and Searle 1979), but it has not been sighted in the wild since 1979 despite continued efforts to relocate the species (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). The disappearance of the species occurred over a period of three to four years, disappearing from the D’Aguilar Range in late 1975, then from the Blackall Range in late 1978, and finally from the Conondale Range in early 1979 (Czechura and Ingram 1990). There is no information on population size, structure, genetics or dynamics (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). This species is now believed to be extinct.",,"This species, an Australian endemic, occurred in disjunctive populations in three sub-coastal mountain ranges (Blackall, Conondale, and D’Aguilar Ranges) in the south-east Queensland region from Coonoon Gibber Creek in the north to Mount Glorious in the south (Czechura and Ingram 1990; Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). The extent of occurrence of the species was about 1,400km² (map in Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). <em>Taudactylus diurnus</em> occurred over a relatively narrow altitudinal range of 350-800m asl with most records falling between 500-800m asl (Czechura and Ingram 1990).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),The species' habitat is fully protected within a National Park.,Australasian,,FALSE,FALSE,Global

10838671,43993,Vanvoorstia bennettiana,Extinct,2003,"The red alga <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> has only ever been collected from two sites (in the world).  The initial discovery, the type locality, was from the seabed at the eastern end of Spectacle Island in Parramatta River sometime between the 1st and the 16th May in 1855.  This site is now operated by the Royal Australian Navy as an explosives storage (barge), administrative offices and a mooring site for destroyers and other large Naval vessels.  The shoreline has been altered and strengthened and the seabed is regularly dredged to allow ample draught for large ships.  This site was first surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards in December 1988.  Since then, seven dives during all seasons up until  23 April 2001, have been undertaken at that site.  No specimens have been discovered, and the only alga found there was a species of the genus <em>Sargassum</em>, that appears to tolerate low light, high nutrient, regularly disturbed conditions.
<br/>
<br/>The only other site known to have harbored this species was on the seabed between Point Piper and Shark Island in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour).  This was collected by Dr Ramsay of the Australian Museum in October 1886.  This site was also surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards firstly in December 1988 then numerous times (approx 10) since.  The seabed in this area now has no solid rocky substrata to which any seaweed could attach, the sediment is approximately 1 m thick (a divers arm disappears to the shoulder) and is easily stirred up by divers and passing ferry traffic.  The surrounding rocky foreshore of both Point Piper and Shark Island have only small amounts of the kelp <em>Ecklonia radiata</em> and the green alga <em>Caulerpa filiformis</em> growing on them. Both are known to tolerate heavily disturbed conditions.  No specimens of <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> have been discovered.
<br/>
<br/>Within Parramatta River and Port Jackson proper, I have logged some 50 dives from 12 different sites, all of which have reasonable coverage of a few marine algal species typical of the NSW coastline.  Based on knowledge of two other species in the genus <em>Vanvoorstia</em>, in addition to known growth strategies and environmental preferences of other genera and species of the red algal family Delesseriaceae, to which <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> belongs, such areas should harbor this species.  In 1913, the then Curator of Algae at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney, Arthur Lucas, published a paper in the Proceedings of the Linnaean Society of NSW in which he states ""I have never obtained it [<em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em>] either cast up or by dredging.""  He was an active collector of algae along the NSW coast up until his death in 1936.  The next Curator of Algae was Ms Valerie May who was also an active collector until her retirement in 1988, when I took over the position.  She was also unable to rediscover this species.
<br/>
<br/>Since 1980, I have logged in excess of 540 dives along the NSW coast as part of  a state government research priority to document the entire marine algal flora of the coast.  Our collections have come from Cape Howe in the very south of the state, to Cook Island on the Queensland/NSW border, with approximately 100 sites scattered in between.  The red algal species <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> has not been discovered during any of these dives.
<br/>
<br/>Several colleagues of mine from the universities of Southern Cross, New England, NSW, Sydney, and Wollongong, plus the Solitary Island Underwater Research Group (SURG), and the operators of every commercial dive shop I have worked through in NSW, have all been briefed on the identification of this and several other rare species of marine algae. None has reported a sighting during the 12 years I have been based at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney. The genus is known to have an isomorphic alternation of generations.  This means that the haploid male and female macrophytic gametophytes are morphologically identical to the diploid macrophytic tetrasporophytes which they ultimately produce.  There is no crustose or resting stage in the life cycle of the species, which may have allowed it to lie dormant for many years until environmental conditions were favourable.  In short, both life stages are susceptible to the same environmental parameters.
<br/>
<br/>The Extinct category is used 'when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.' With negative data there can always be some doubt. And new species continue to be found in Australian marine waters, even in Sydney Harbour (J.R. Paxton in litt.). The presence of 15 individuals in one collection indicates that  the species was relatively common in at least one portion of Sydney Harbour at that time. Given the isomorphic alternation of generations, it seems most unlikely that the species would remain in existence and remain undetected for more than 100 years. Therefore as no specimens have been seen or collected in the intervening 116 years, despite numerous collections made by algologists in that period, the species can be considered truly Extinct.","Unknown at time of collection in 1855 and 1886.  The two sites, and much of Sydney Harbour, presently has soft sediment seabed with scattered rocky reef and rocky intertidal shores.  Scattered shells and solid waste products (cans, bottles etc.) also lie on the seabed.","Sydney Harbour is in the middle of the city of Sydney, the largest metropolis in Australia with more than 4 million people. In the 200+ years since settlement, the harbour has been seriously degraded by the population explosion. Use of the harbour as recreational facility, port, source of food, and sewer has seriously impacted on the native flora and fauna. Even by 1880, the harbour was found to be overfished by a Royal Commission. The Major Threats that may have caused the extinction of this alga include large and small scale fisheries particularly trawling, infrastructure development including industry, human settlement, tourism/recreation, water transport [including dredging for ship passage], fisheries- related bycatch by netting, and water pollution from agriculture, domestic, commercial/ industrial, oil, sedimentation, and sewage. The water quality of the harbour has improved since the 1972 passage of the New South Wales Clean Waters Act and the more recent removal of sewage outfalls some kilometers offshore. More fish species have moved to the upper estuarine portions of the Parramatta River and whales have returned to the outer harbour. However, for sessile species of limited distribution like Bennetts seaweed, swimming out of the harbour was not an option and the damage was done, permanently. As we do not even know in which decade the extinction occurred, we will never know which of the major threats was causative; a combination of a number of those listed is likely.

This was a crepuscular and partially nocturnal lizard (Vaillant 1882), which preyed on bird eggs and fledglings (Hazevoet 1994). Animals would also scavenge dead birds (Hazevoet 1994). Females laid two eggs per clutch (Andreone and Guarino 2003). It is hypothesized that sexual maturity was reached at five (males) or six (females) years of age (Andreone and Guarino 2003), but age estimation in these lizards is uncertain and maturity may have been reached later. Sexual dimorphism was most pronounced after eight years.","Rats, cats and dogs have all been introduced to Santa Luzia, where they represented the major predators of this lizard (Andreone and Guarino 2003). As well as directly preying on the skink, rats and cats competed with them for food and may have caused declines in the seabird colonies on which this lizard relies. Particularly in times of drought, humans have also used the skink as a food source (Schleich 1982), for medicine and skins (Bocage 1873), and commercial trade for scientific purposes (Andreone and Guarino 2003). Low population numbers and recruitment, slow growth rates (Andreone and Guarino 2003), and a restricted range on a single island and two smaller islets all put this skink at extremely high risk from these threatening processes, as well as from stochastic events (particularly droughts, thought likely to have contributed to the species' extinction - Andreone<em> </em>2000), and it is now thought to be extinct.","This species was last seen alive in 1912, and has been considered extinct by some authors (e.g. Andreone and Guarino 2003) and in the First Red List of Cape Verde (Schleich 1996). A recent five-day survey of Santa Luzia failed to recover evidence of a surviving population (Miralles <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011, Vasconcelos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2013), and these authors likewise concluded that this skink is now extinct. The most recent record of this species was a mandible of a juvenile collected from cat faeces on Santa Luzia in 2005, since when the cat population has increased and the invasive animals are now widespread on the island (R.

13483086,2864,Bolyeria multocarinata,Extinct,2021,"This species has not been recorded since 1975 despite active conservation efforts on Round Island. Soil erosion and extensive loss of habitat as a result of introduced herbivores have been blamed for the extinction of this snake. Introduced mammalian predators, principally rats, have been identified as the leading cause of historical declines elsewhere in Mauritius and are likely to have resulted in the loss of this species from the main island, likely in the mid-19th century.","Not much is known about this snake's ecology, but its morphology with a blunt snout and no neck suggests it was a sub-fossorial species (Vinson 1953, 1975). A snake suspected of being a burrowing boa was reported to quickly burrow into holes in the ground (Vinson 1953). Bullock (1977) reported that the individual caught in 1975 burrowed through loose soil and plant material with ease.&#160; It is thought that the boa would have lived primarily in the understorey of hardwood and palm-rich forests (Vinson 1953, Bullock 1977). Its specialized jaw morphology is similar to that of the keel-scaled boa (Frazzetta 1970, Cundall and Irish 1986, 1989) and suggests that it predated terrestrial lizards and ground nesting/burrowing seabird chicks, but maybe also lizard and bird eggs. Dissection of a female specimen at the Zoological Museum, Hamburg showed it to contain five eggs (Hallermann and Glaw 2006).<br/><br/>An individual collected in 1935 measured 85 cm in length; individuals caught in 1953 and 1967 both measured 95 cm in length (Vinson 1975) and the last individual caught in 1975 was 88 cm in length (Bullock 1977). The five museum specimens measure between 54 and 140 cm (Bauer and Günther 2004). Other specimens have been reported to be up to 180 cm in length (Vinson 1949). The dorsal colouration was light brown with small blackish spots, becoming larger and joining towards the posterior of the body, with vertical streaks on the side of the tail and the ventral colour of the snake was pinkish and marbled and tinged with black (Vinson 1975).","Historically, the bolyerid snakes underwent a rapid decline, because of human visitation and occupation of Mauritius from the 1500s that led to widespread habitat destruction and the introduction of non-native species. Introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (Arnold 2000, Cheke and Hume 2008) and possibly cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are thought to have been the main cause of initial declines and loss. Snakes that were encountered on the islands were also shot by early visitors (Cheke 1987, Cheke and Hume 2008). Once restricted to Round Island, introduced goats and rabbits denuded the island of much its vegetation and caused extensive loss of soil, thus removing the burrowing boas’ habitat and their likely reptile prey resources. It is also likely that habitat loss would have led to increased predation of juvenile burrowing boas by the endemic Telfair’s Skink <em>Leiolopisma telfairii</em>.","By 1881, the bolyerid snakes were restricted to Round Island, with rats having invaded Gunner’s Quoin (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) and Flat Island (<em>R. rattus</em>) (Cheke and Hume 2008). By the 1900s, the burrowing boa was extremely rare on Round Island with single encounters in 1935, 1953 and 1967, despite repeated searches between the latter two dates (Vinson 1975). The fourth and last individual was detected in August 1975 (Bullock 1977). The removal of goats (<em>Capra aegagrus hircus</em>) in 1979 and rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) in 1986 (Merton 1987), followed by the recovery and restoration of the island’s habitat occurred too late for the burrowing boa: despite extensive searches and a full time presence of conservation staff on Round Island since 2002, the snake has not been detected (Cole<em> et al.</em> 2018) and is considered to be extinct.",,"The Round Island Burrowing Boa was a Mauritian endemic known from Round Island (2.19 km<sup>2</sup>).&#160;The burrowing boa was thought to have occurred on mainland Mauritius, but it is uncertain whether sub-fossil vertebrae belong to this burrowing boa or the extant Keel-scaled Boa <em>Casarea dussumieri </em>(Arnold 1980). If the former, the species is likely to have become locally extinct on this island in the mid-1800s due to the invasion of introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em> and<em> R. rattus</em>). Snakes of the size of the Round Island Burrowing Boa and Keel-scaled Boa were recorded on the offshore islets Gunner’s Quoin (0.70 km2) and Flat Island (2.53 km<sup>2</sup>) in the north until at least 1839 and Ile de la Passe (0.02 km2) in the southeast in the 1760s (Cheke 1987, Cheke and Hume 2008).

It was probably primarily insectivorous in common with its extant relatives (Probst 1998)","This species is extinct, and the most likely cause of its extinction is the introduction of the Southeast Asian Wolf Snake (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>), a specialist feeder on lizards, to Réunion in the mid-19th century (Austin&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009). The documented timing of this snake's establishment on both Réunion (by 1840, based on testimony taken in 1839 - Cheke 1987) and mainland Mauritius (before 1873 - Daruty de Grandpré 1883) coincides with the extinction of <em>Gongylomorphus </em>skinks on both islands.&#160;Musk Shews (<em>Suncus murinus</em>), have been observed preying on Mauritian <em>Gongylomorphus</em>&#160;(Cole 2011), and this invasive species probably contributed to the historical decline (M.

Historical accounts describe how they could rapidly change colour from the vibrant green to black (Vinson and Vinson 1969). The geckos were reported to measure 20 to 27 cm in total length (Vinson and Vinson 1969), with museum specimens ranging in size from 155 to 207 mm in total length, with snout to vent lengths of 85 to 108 mm (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bour et al. 2014). The tooth morphology suggests that the species was primarily frugivorous (N. Arnold pers. obs. in Austin <em>et al. </em>2014). Historical accounts state that they consumed the fruit of palm trees, flies and other insects and had a liking for palms, but would venture into buildings, onto roofs and were very tame (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Austin <em>et al. </em>2014, Cheke and Hume 2008). Natural predators that were recorded by early visitors to Rodrigues consisted of the now extinct Rodrigues Night Heron (<em>Nycticorax megacephalus</em>) and Rodrigues Owl (<em>Mascarenotus murivorus</em>)&#160;(Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008).","This gecko species is likely to have become extinct as a result of predation by introduced rats that were present on the main island by the late 1600s, and possibly cats introduced between 1725 and 1761 to control rat populations (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008). By the late 1800s, when the geckos were scarce or had already possibly become restricted to the islets, much of the forests had gone (Cheke and Hume 2008). It is therefore likely that habitat loss was a contributory factor, although when recorded in abundance on Ile aux Foux in the late 1700s, there was virtually no vegetation and the geckos would take refuge in rock crevices (Vinson and Vinson 1969).","This species is extinct. Only seven preserved specimens are known, six of which are in museums (Bour <em>et al</em>. 2014), in addition to numerous sub-fossil bones from approximately 100 individuals (Austin <em>et al</em>. 2004). The species survived for longer than other endemic lizards on Rodrigues, none of which are extant. Until 1795, it was still abundant on the main island and was probably found on several of the 21 offshore islets, but the only islet from which it was confirmed as being present is Ile aux Fous (0.33 ha), where it was recorded in great numbers by Pingré in 1761 (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bour <em>et al.</em> 2014). In the late 1700s, Philibert Marragon observed that fewer geckos were encountered in winter compared to summer (Vinson and Vinson 1969).

21425735,11073,Labidura herculeana,Extinct,2014,"This is the world’s largest known earwig, attaining a length of up to 80 mm. A total of 40 specimens were collected from the Horse Point area during the two Belgian expeditions from the Royal Museum for Central Africa in 1965-6 and 1967 (Brindle 1970). Live specimens were not found at any other sites at this time although they reported fragments of dead individuals from the south and east flanks of Flagstaff. There are a couple of unconfirmed records that the species was present after this time and it was thought to be declining. Two expeditions were conducted by Paul Pearce-Kelly from the London Zoo in 1988 and 1993, however, they failed to find any trace of the species. Recent intensive survey work in the 1990s and 2000s by Philip and Myrtle Ashmole failed to locate the species in this or nearby areas (Ashmole and Ashmole 2003). Howard Mendel from the Natural History Museum in London also failed to find it during a visit with the Ashmoles in 2005-6. The habitat at Horse Point has been degraded as far as this species is concerned since the time of the Belgian expeditions by the removal of nearly all surface stones, under which specimens were then found, for construction purposes. There has also been potential increased predator pressure from mice and rats, and probably also from invasive non-native predatory invertebrates including spiders and the centipede <em>Scolopendra morsitans</em>&#160;Linnaeus, 1758. The only possible evidence that this species may have persisted beyond the time of the Belgian expeditions has been the discovery of fragments of dead individuals. A sub-fossil forcep and ninth abdominal tergite was found with bird bones in 1995 near Prosperous Bay. Two further ninth abdominal tergites have been recovered since. The first was found under a discarded piece of equipment in the centre of Horse Point Plain in 2013; the second in a small area at the Millennium Forest in 2014 where some remaining surface rock is present. However, this second fragment was found in a concentration of invertebrate remains in the lair of a predatory spider. As all of these remains are fragmentary and the insect itself relatively robust with remains persisting potentially for many decades it has to be assumed that these specimens had been dead for a considerable time. The species is large, charismatic and of iconic status on the island; while there is still a slim possibility that it may still persist in some remote location, the balance of evidence points towards the species being extinct. The last confirmed adult sighting was in May 1967.","The species is xerophilus and nocturnal. At Horse Point the species was mostly found in burrows beneath stones with the adults appearing during the summer rains (December to February), seeking shelter again at the onset of drier weather (Brindle 1970). The burrows extended for a considerable distance and eventually become lost in fissures in the soil. When disturbed the adults tried to escape by running into these burrows. Mating was observed twice on 22/12/1965 and 1/2/1967 and a females with eggs were observed on 8/3/1967 and 24/3/1967.

It was terrestrial, climbed trees, and was present all over the island, which was at the time mostly covered by tropical moist forest. Lister (1888) noted that ""they generally keep to the ground, but are able to climb trees."" Andrews (1900), who apparently was more impressed by their climbing ability, said they ""ascend trees to a great height"" in pursuit of fruits and young shoots, and ""I have often seen them run up the trailing stems of the lianas, and, in fact, they can climb as well as a squirrel."" Little is known of their diet, except that they were fond of fruits and young shoots.<br/>Nothing more is known about the habitat and ecology of this species aside from what is contained in the following lines: ""In the daytime these rats live in holes among the roots of trees, in decaying logs, and shallow burrows. They seem to breed all the year round"" (Andrews 1900).","This species was still abundant in 1897-1898 while Andrews was on Christmas Island (Andrews 1900). By the time he returned to the island in 1908, he was confident that it and the other native rat species, <em>Rattus nativitatis</em>, were extinct (Andrews 1909). Andrews (1909) speculated that introduced Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> had brought an epidemic disease to the island that wiped out both native rats. Nearly 100 years later, the mystery was finally solved by Wyatt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2008), who used ancient DNA methods on samples from museum specimens of these rodents collected during the extinction window (AD 1888–1908), and showed that endemic rats collected prior to the introduction of Black Rats were devoid of evidence of a pathogenic trypanosome (carried by fleas hosted on recently-introduced Black Rats). <br/><br/>To Andrews, the disappearance of such an abundant animal in such a short time had to be due to disease because <em>R. rattus</em> was not present over the entire island. It was unreasonable therefore to assume that the native species had been out-competed by <em>R. rattus</em> all over the island (Andrews 1909). Two predators had been introduced to the island by 1908, cat and dog, but these were far too few to rid the island of the rats (Andrews 1900, 1909). Although Christmas Island had an increasing human settlement at Flying Fish Cove, roads now crossed the island, and there was active phosphate mining, there was still a lot of native forest and even collectively these human disturbances were unlikely to have caused significant declines in the populations of Maclear's Rat (Andrews 1909). Andrews (1909) also relates anecdotal information that a medical officer on the island, Dr. McDougal, recalled frequently seeing ""individuals of the native species of rats crawling about the paths in the daytime, apparently in a dying condition"" in 1902-1904. <br/><br/>Pickering and Norris (1996) report on documents concerning Maclear's Rat that were uncovered at Oxford University, and specimens from the Zoological Collections, University Museum, Oxford University and the University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge. The documents include notes for a lecture by K. R. Hanitsch who visited Christmas Island for five weeks in 1904 and was unable to locate either species of native rat. Dr. Durham, a pathologist, visited the island from November 1901 to March 1902 and reported in expedition reports that he was told that <em>R. rattus</em> had been introduced to the island in 1899 by the S.S. Hindustan. Durham also collected 19 rat specimens. Pickering and Norris (1996) note that some of these specimens were of <em>R. macleari</em>, <em>R. rattus</em>, and some of varying degrees of hybrid between <em>R. macleari</em> and <em>R. rattus</em>. Hybridisation between the two species, with the implication that <em>R. macleari</em> was genetically swamped by <em>R. rattus,</em> was put forward as a contributing factor in the demise of <em>R. macleari</em> (Pickering and Norris 1996). However, hybridisation between the two species is unlikely given the phylogenetic distance between them, and apparently re-examination of specimens confirms that each belongs to one or the other species (Musser and Carleton 2005; Aplin 2008). This is further supported by the molecular studies of Wyatt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2008).<br/><br/>Because Durham collected specimens, some of which were <em>R. macleari</em>, in late 1901 and 1902, <em>R. macleari</em> must have become extinct after 1901. <br/><br/>McDougal was the last person to recall seeing native rats alive, albeit in the act of dying (Andrews 1909). These rats were probably <em>R. macleari</em> because <em>R. nativitatis</em> was the rarer of the two, as evidenced by the fact that Durham was unable to collect any specimens of <em>R. nativitatis</em> in 1901-1902. Andrews (1909) writes that McDougal's recollections are from 5-6 years before, but it is unclear whether he meant 5-6 years prior to his 1909 publication (putting the date at 1903-1904), or if it was 5-6 years prior to 1908 when Andrews was on Christmas Island (putting the date as 1902-1903 as Pickering and Norris (1996) interpret the anecdote). Because Hanitsch was unable to locate the species in 1904, it is likely that the species already had become extinct.<br/>Green (2014) further defined the date of introduction of black rats (and hence trypanosomes) (September 1900) and the extinction of <em>R. macleari </em>(between April 1904 and October 1904).","Maclear's Rat became extinct probably between 1902 and 1904. It was, however, abundant on Christmas Island at the close of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Lister visited the island in 1887 and said of Maclear's Rat, it ""abounds all over the island"" (Lister 1888). Andrews (1900) who was on the island for ten months, 1897-1898, noted that it was ""by far the commonest of the mammals found in the island; in every part I visited, it occurred in swarms. During the day nothing is to be seen of it, but soon after sunset numbers may be seen running about in all directions.""

Its short tail and robust hands and feet demonstrate that it was equipped for life as a fossorial species (Thomas 1888, Forsyth Major 1900). It is interesting, however, that its skull was described as ""particularly small, slender, and delicate"" (Thomas 1888).<br/><br/>In any case, the species was often seen in and around burrows, and, unlike <em>R. macleari</em>, it did not climb trees. Andrews (1900) summed up what he knew of the animal: ""They seem to live in small colonies in burrows, often among the roots of a tree, and occasionally several may be found living in the long, hollow trunk of a fallen and half-decayed sago-palm (<em>Arenga listeri</em>). The food consists of wild fruits, young shoots, and, I believe, the bark of some trees.""","This species was last recorded by Andrews from his 10 month stay on Christmas Island 1897-1898 (Andrews 1900). At that time, it already appeared to be in decline. Although the species was known from the settlement at Flying Fish Cove, Andrews never encountered them there and believed they were mainly confined to higher ground (Andrews 1900, 1909). In the hills, he described them as ""very numerous in places"", but less common than <em>R. macleari</em> (Andrews 1900). Andrews (1900) states that ""it is difficult to avoid the belief that the former species [<em>R. nativitatis</em>] is being supplanted by the latter [<em>R. macleari</em>] in spite of the abundance of food.""<br/><br/>By the time Andrews revisited the island in 1908, he was confident in pronouncing the species to be extinct (Andrews 1909). In 1904, Hanitsch visited the island hoping to collect specimens of the native rats, but was unable to locate either species (Pickering and Norris 1996; see account for <em>R. macleari</em> for further details). Durham visited the island in November of 1901 to March 1902 and collected <em>R. macleari</em> and <em>R. rattus</em>, but was unable to obtain <em>R. nativitatis</em>, despite offering a reward to the local inhabitants (Pickering and Norris 1996; see account for <em>R. macleari</em> for further details). Pickering and Norris (1996) note that Durham did not go far from Flying Fish Cove during his stay, thus he could well have missed <em>R. nativitatis</em>. However, Hanitsch's failure to obtain <em>R. nativitatis</em> in 1904 likely means that the species was extinct by this time. Andrews (1909) relates anecdotal information that a medical officer on the island, Dr. McDougal, recalled frequently seeing ""individuals of the native species of rats crawling about the paths in the daytime, apparently in a dying condition"" in 1902-1904, and these may have included <em>R. nativitatis</em>, but were likely to be <span style=""font-style: italic;"">R. macleari</span> (see account for <em>R. macleari</em> for further details). <br/><br/>The demise of the Bulldog Rat was certainly rapid, going from locally common to extinct in less than eight years.

Black Rats are thought to have been introduced to the island by the S.S. Hindustan in 1899 (Pickering and Norris 1996) - subsequently determined to be September 1900 by Green (2014).

The diet was mainly vegetarian, including leaves of chenopods, other semi-succulent shrubs and grasses, but also included invertebrates such as beetles and termites (Copley 1999). The different food preferences (if not habitat preferences) between the two species of stick-nest rats are reflected in their molar teeth. Although both have incisors that are similar in being relatively narrow and fairly lightly built, their molars are very different. Those of&#160; the Lesser Stick-nest Rat are fairly low-crowned, with quite sloping cusps and with the lophs in the lower molars forming a characteristic chevron pattern, all suggesting that the species fed on relatively high quality food, such as sandalwood nuts (whose shells are usually found in quite large numbers in their stick-nests). In contrast, the molars of the Greater Stick-nest Rat <em>L. conditor</em> are very high-crowned, with almost vertical cusps, suggesting that they fed on larger volumes of lower quality vegetation, such as saltbush, which was fairly abrasive, because old individuals in owl pellet accumulations have quite worn-down teeth (A. Baynes pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The construction of stick-nests shows that shelter was important; the nests probably provided an ameliorated microclimate and some protection from predators. A nest may have sheltered several individuals, with records of up to ten in a nest.<br/><br/>Radiocarbon dates of Stick-nest Rat nest-middens have revealed dates ranging from modern to 10,900 ± 90 BP (Pearson <em>et al</em>. 1999). Pearson and Dodson (1991), Pearson (1999) and Webeck and Pearson (2005) have studied Stick-nest Rat middens to document past changes in vegetation and climate in central Australia, while Pearson <em>et al</em>. (2001) have documented animal remains in the nest-middens.</p>","Predation by feral cats is considered the main cause of extinction. Cats had colonized the whole of Australia by the 1890s (Abbott 2002, 2008). The arrival of Red Foxes in range may have driven remnant subpopulations to extinction; high rabbit numbers led to high fox numbers. Habitat degradation, particularly in refuges during drought, caused by introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits and sheep) before and leading into severe drought conditions may have contributed to extinction. Morton (1990) and Copley (1999) have discussed the effects of introduced herbivores on this and other extinct mammals; Tunbridge (1991) described effects of sheep at the Flinders Ranges. Predation by indigenous predators, such as Dingoes and owls, in combination with habitat degradation by introduced herbivores was probably a minor threat on its own but possibly an enhanced threat when other threats were operating.","<p>Krefft (1866) reported Lesser Stick-nest Rats ‘in great numbers … on both sides of the Murray River’, i.e., New South Wales and Victoria). Many early explorers commented on the abundance and large size of stick-nests, including in northern areas where only this species of <em>Leporillus</em> has been recorded (Copley 1999). However, by the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, explorers and naturalists reported that it was rare. Western desert Aboriginal people reported that it disappeared at least 40 to 50 years prior to the mid-1980s (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988).

Anderson (1995) discussed the ecological interaction between sea cows, sea otters, <em>Strongylocentrotus</em> sea urchins, and kelp, and suggested that human predation on sea otters (resulting in a nearshore community dominated by sea urchins, which largely eliminate shallow-water kelps leading to their replacement by chemically defended deep-water species) was a major factor, along with hunting, in sea cow extinction. Turvey <em>et al.</em> (2006) assessed whether hunting alone would have been sufficient to wipe out the sea cow, and showed that the speed of sea cow disappearance on Bering Island indicates that hunting alone was more than sufficient to exterminate the species without having to invoke any additional ecological pressures.&#160;Conversely, Estes <em>et al.</em> (2015) argued that hunting of sea otters alone could account for the sea cows’ extinction. Since both pressures actually occurred, there is no difficulty in understanding the rapid disappearance of <em>Hydrodamalis</em> from the Commander Islands.<br/><p><em></em></p>","Steller's Sea Cow was discovered in 1741 in the shallow waters around the uninhabited Commander Islands. The relict Bering Island population was studied by Georg Steller (a naturalist and physician onboard Vitus Bering's ship wrecked on the island in 1741). The sea cow was an easily available source of meat and the islands became a regular stop-over and stocking up point for Russian fur hunters until 1762-1763. Ruthlessly hunted, Steller's Sea Cow was probably extinct by 1768. Turvey and Risley (2006) presented a preliminary mathematical model of its extinction dynamics, providing evidence that the initial Bering Island sea cow population must have been higher than the 1,500 animals suggested by Stejneger (1887) to allow the species to survive even until 1768.&#160;Estes<em> et al.</em> (2015) presented further population modelling to show that hunting of sea otters could have driven the sea cows to extinction even without direct human overkill of the latter.<br/><p></p>",,"Steller's Sea Cow was known from the Bering Sea.

Their diet is unknown, but may have included eels, lobsters, octopus, and reef fish. Like other true seals, the Caribbean Monk Seal was sluggish on land, and its lack of fear of humans and an unaggressive and curious nature contributed to its demise. They were medium-sized seals, with adult standard lengths of 200-240 cm (Allen 2004). Very little is known about the natural history of&#160; the Caribbean Monk Seal, but related species mature at 4-8 years old, give birth to a single pup (usually annually), and can live to be more than 20 years old.","The only known predators of Caribbean Monk Seals were sharks and humans. Intensive exploitation began with the voyages of Columbus, and continued for centuries afterwards, as the seals were killed for their skins and oil. In more recent years, the seal was also subject to persecution from the fishing industry. This human pressure brought the population to very low numbers, ultimately resulting in extinction of the species (Allen 2004, Hairr 2011).","Caribbean Monk Seals were first discovered by Columbus in 1494, and early records testify to its abundance in several parts of the Caribbean. Population size prior to exploitation has been estimated as 233,000-338,000 (McClenachan and Cooper 2007). Hunting of Caribbean Monk Seals by Europeans for food began with Columbus, and many animals were killed for that reason over the following centuries. In the late 1600s hundreds of seals were killed primarily to be used for oil to lubricate machinery on sugar plantations. Additional animals were taken for public display and killed for museum specimens and other reasons (Hairr 2011). By the late 1880s the species was rare, though the Triangle Keys west of Yucatan remained a stronghold of the species until 1915 when about 200 animals were killed there (<a href=""http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/"">The Sixth Extinction Website</a> 2007). The last reliable record from anywhere was of a small colony at Seranilla Bank, a group of tiny coral islands halfway between Jamaica and Honduras, in 1952 (Adams 2004). An aerial survey in 1973 covering much of the species known range did not produce any seal sightings (Kenyon 1977).

54365740,56413,Craugastor anciano,Extinct,2019,"Listed as Extinct. It was last seen in 1990, and exhaustive surveys at the species' known sites and the only other adjacent site with suitable habitat at suitable elevations have failed to record the species in several decades. The species experienced drastic population declines, probably due to chytridiomycosis and habitat loss, and has apparently not recuperated.","This species lived on the ground along mountain streams in premontane and lower montane moist forest. It presumably bred by direct development, with eggs laid on land, similar to other species in the <em>Craugastor rugulosus</em>&#160;series&#160;(McCranie and Castaneda 2007). It was not though to have tolerated habitat disturbance.","Species of the <em>Craugastor rugulosus</em> group appear to have undergone dramatic declines between mid 1980s to early 1990s across Honduras, including within undisturbed habitat which is a strong indicator of chytrid-related declines (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Chytridiomycosis is thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by&#160;agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides.&#160;The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). The second locality, Rio Arcaqual, is affected at lower elevations by a small dam that is undergoing increased use pressure by local communities; and if the species was still present, then it is thought that this would be a threat to it (L. Herrera, J. Townsend and H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><br/>Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g.<em>&#160;</em>chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).","It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct.

Although it is thought to have inhabited the most remote parts of St Helena, the likelihood of this distinctive species remaining undiscovered on a small and well-botanized island is very low.","All known localities occur in areas which are now extremely barren and arid, typically in dry coastal valleys or on screes and hills near the sea, 0 – 200 m altitude. It is somewhat difficult today to understand how a tree species, reputed to develop a trunk up to one metre in diameter, could have thrived in such inhospitable places, especially since most Dombeyoideae species are adapted to reasonably moist habitats. One explanation is that the climate in the lower valleys may have changed substantially around the time of human arrival – a factor which could have contributed to the demise of the species. However, there is no obvious evidence to support this hypothesis. Alternatively, the very dense wood suggests that plants were extremely slow-growing, and this may indicate tolerance of extremely harsh conditions. The small, densely tomentose leaves also display a morphology typically adapted to minimize water loss.","The decline of the Ebony appears to have occurred soon after St Helena was discovered by the Portuguese fleet in 1502. It is highly likely that goat grazing played a major role in the demise. Goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) were introduced by early ships to provide meat, and rapidly multiplied into large flocks which caused extensive damage to the vegetation of dry areas. A settlement was not established on St Helena until 1659, yet large stands of dead Ebony Trees were discovered in Sandy Bay within 20 years, and were felled soon after to fuel a nearby lime kiln.

The small blooms were mainly pollinated by hoverflies, and matured into dry capsules which took up to a year to ripen (Jackson 1991).</p>","<p>The majority of the population was probably lost to deforestation following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658. Trees were cleared for pasture land and also to provide fuel and timber, for which the hard, yellow wood was probably reasonably prized. Only fragments of the original mid-altitude forest cover remained by the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century, and by the time of Melliss’s records in the late 1800s there was little native vegetation away from the highest elevations. Further extensive damage was inflicted in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century when large plantations of New Zealand flax (<em>Phormium tenax</em> J.R.Forst. &amp; G.Forst.) were established over the steep slopes of the Central Ridge, although it appears that the species was already close to extinction by this time.<br/><br/>Once severely reduced in numbers, small population size appears to have created further, inherent problems through low self-compatibility and perhaps also through inbreeding depression which may have reduced resilience to pests. It is entirely possible that susceptibility to introduced fungal pathogens may have played a longer term role in the overall demise.</p>","<p>Intact fragments of St Helena Olive habitat probably persisted until the late 1800s, when Solander noted trees up to 30 foot high (approx. 9 m) (see Cronk 2002). A century later, only 12-15 trees remained, and these reputedly attained little more than half the former stature (Melliss 1875). When George Benjamin discovered a single specimen near Mt Actaeon* in 1977 the species had not been seen for many years. This proved to be the last known wild specimen in existence. It died in 1994 but seedlings and a cutting had been propagated from it, and a few cultivated individuals continued the line. Unfortunately these did not survive long, the last succumbing to fungal infections in 2003.<br/><br/>(*There is some controversy of the naming of the three summits in the Diana’s Peak range.

Nearly all old records are from the Diana’s Peak area, although Roxburgh also noted it from “the Sandy Bay range” (see Beatson 1816), presumably meaning that it was more widely distributed along the Central Ridge.","The wood was undoubtedly used for timber, but the harvest is unlikely to have been regular since the mid 19th Century as specimens have become increasingly scarce.",Terrestrial,"After the rediscovery of the single tree in 1977, an intensive rescue attempt was mounted in with expert help from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (Jackson 1991).

79818502,4288,Rucervus schomburgki,Extinct,2015,"The wild Thai population of Schomburgk’s Deer died out around 1932, with the last captive individual being killed in 1938. None of the indications that the species inhabited other countries can be shown to have any compelling basis and some are clearly in error. Thus the species is considered a single-country endemic, to Thailand, where it is certainly Extinct.","The species inhabited seasonally inundated swampy plains with long grass, cane, and shrubs; it apparently avoided forest (Giles 1937), although there seems to be no information on where animals went at the height of the wet season, when much of the dry-season range was under water.","Commercial production of rice for export began in the late nineteenth century in Thailand’s central plains, leading to the loss of nearly all the grassland and swamp areas that this deer depended on, and greatly fragmented what remained. Intensive hunting pressure at the turn of the 19th–20th century restricted the species further and it disappeared in the 1930s. Schomburgk’s Deer was prominent in the antlers sought by the Chinese medicine trade (Harper 1945). During the wet season, animals marooned on higher ground were hunted readily with spears from boats (Harper 1945), no doubt hastening the species' decline.","Schomburgk’s Deer was apparently “not uncommon” in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and herds still occurred around 1900–1910 (Harper 1945), but the species underwent a very rapid decline: Harper (1945) stated that it was never seen in the wild state by a European (although this may be better taken as a lack of such reports, because Europeans working, for example, on the Paknampo railway in the early days would almost surely have seen and hunted these deer; G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). The usually successful hunter Arthur S. Vernay made three trips to Thailand specifically for the species, the first in 1920, but failed to see the species. There are some hundreds of skulls, frontlet and antlers in collections (Harper 1945), but the species is now extinct.",,"<em>Rucervus schomburgki</em> was endemic to Thailand and is thought to have become extinct when the last captive individual was killed in 1938; the last known wild animals were killed in 1932 near Sai Yoke and Kwae Yai, although this date was not universally accepted at the time (Harper 1945, Lekagul and McNeely 1988). The recent range in Thailand seems to have lain within 13°30′–18°N, 98°30′–102°E, comprising the central plain of Thailand (Giles 1937, Harper 1945, G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Attempts to circumscribe the range have, however, been bedevilled by a surprisingly large number of statements of occurrence elsewhere.<br/><br/>Statements of occurrence in the Sanda Valley, Yunnan, China by Sclater (1891: 180) and Bentham (1908) led to this locality being included without any caveat by Grubb (2005), and relate to both a frontlet and a skin. However, Sclater (1891) listed the set of antlers as of unknown locality, and the skin has a ""?"" mark that makes its Sanda Valley locality no more than tentative (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Then, Bentham (1908) indicated that the antlers had been collected in the Sanda Valley by John Anderson in 1878, without giving explicit source for this statement. In fact, Anderson was in the Sanda Valley in 1868, not 1878, and moreover recorded no such antlers in his thorough write-up of zoological results of his Yunnan expeditions. This locality assignment for the antlers should be seen as an error of Bentham's, presumably stemming from the earlier, tentative, assignment of Sanda Valley to the deer skin Sclater also reported (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Pocock (1943) included under distribution of the species “N. Siam [Thailand] and, it has been alleged, Yunnan and Lao PDR”, indicating his own concern with the Sanda valley ‘evidence’. The Shan states (Myanmar) have also figured as part of the species’s range, e.g. by Blanford (1891: 540). Reference to historical occurrence in these areas seems to stem from Brooke (1876), who wrote, based on written communication from a Dr Campbell of the Bangkok British Consulate) in reference to new specimens sent to him that "". . . all specimens were procured in northern Siam, probably even in the tributary states named Laos and Shan"". Campbell seems to have based his opinion at least partly on what professional indigenous hunters told him or others. Brooke gave no definition of ""northern Siam"" (conceivably it simply meant some way north of Bangkok), and Lao PDR in this context could well have included part or all of the Korat Plateau and other areas in present-day Thailand which are ethnically Lao and were often referred to in the past by terms such as ‘Siamese Laos’. It is not even clear that Lao PDR and Shan were not just speculation on the part of Campbell and/or Brooke (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Harper (1945) considered the Shan states report to be “highly indefinite” and occurrence in “Indo-China” [presumably = Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam] to be “in error”, although he took the ‘Sanda valley’ frontlet as “apparently authentic”, perhaps being focussed on the identity (which is not in doubt) rather than the provenance (presumably assuming that the association with the highly-respected Anderson’s name was enough). A more modern reanalysis concluded that ""the northern Thailand, Myanmar, Yunnan, and Lao PDR range extensions suggested in the literature are based on erroneous or quite inconclusive items of evidence"", sometimes perhaps influenced by a switch of Thai names between Eld’s and Schomburgk’s Deer by Flower (1900) (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Two loose antlers, presumed to be a pair, of Schomburgk’s Deer photographed in Phongsali province, far northern Lao PDR, in 1991 were a most surprising find. This has been taken to suggest the species might survive, at least into the 1980s, and that it did indeed occur in Lao PDR (Schroering 1995) and it was even taken as sufficient evidence that the species was not extinct by MacPhee and Flemming (1999). However, while these are indeed Schomburgk’s Deer antlers, it has proven impossible to recover a consistent story from their owner of the antlers’ origin (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999) and there is no compelling evidence that they had come from a recently killed animal, rather than being decades-old stock still in trade; Williams (1941) noted that even then that Schomburgk’s Deer antlers ""keep coming down to Bangkok from Paknampo and Korat by railway amongst collections of ordinary deer-horns consigned to Bangkok Chinamen . . . the horns are probably quite old . . ."" and Schomburgk’s Deer antlers are still in trade in Thailand (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992). The owner of the antlers was, according to his daughter, a middleman trader in wildlife parts sourced from all over Indochina (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008, based on visit in 1996). Consequently, while remains of the species have been seen in Lao PDR in recent times, they cannot be taken as evidence that the species survives today, or ever occurred in Lao PDR.","Relics of this extinct species (usually antlers) are still traded to a limited extent. During its last few decades of existence Schomburgk's Deer was hunted heavily, presumably for meat, and certainly for antlers which went into the Chinese medicine trade (e.g. Williams 1941, Harper 1945).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"As an extinct species there are no appropriate conservation measures.

This failed to find any further evidence of the species there or to elicit a consistent story of the origin of the antlers (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, per J.W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Given regional trends in Schomburgk’s Deer’s sole known habitat, non-forest floodplains (its massive conversion to agriculture over the last 150 years) it is unlikely that the species could survive.

Extensive surveys targeting handfish species have been conducted throughout this area in the shallow habitats that this species occupied, but no individuals have been found.

Other shallow handfish species (e.g., <em>Brachionichthys hirsutus</em>) have experienced severe population declines due to their very limited dispersal capabilities, small subpopulations and impacts from invasive species, habitat loss and pollution (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017). The main, general threats that cause declines in handfish species include loss of spawning substrate, habitat loss and degradation, water pollution and siltation, the spread of the invasive Northern Pacific seastar (<em>Asterias amurensis</em>) and the cumulative impacts of boating (Commonwealth of Australia 2015). Large scallop and oyster fisheries, which were active in southeastern Tasmania from the late 19<sup>th</sup> century until collapse in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel by 1967, dredged every part of the channel.

Extensive habitat loss has occurred in the region, and the remaining fragments are small and isolated (Butchart&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Following the application of new methods for estimating the probability of a species remaining extant, the species is now considered to be Extinct. The species's decline was largely a result of logging, felling for charcoal and conversion of forest to sugarcane plantations and pastureland.","It inhabited the edges of clearings in interior upland forest at 400-550 m, from the understorey to the subcanopy, and has been observed in selectively logged and old secondary forests. Birds have been found singly, in pairs or small groups, and often joined mixed-species flocks. Food was gleaned from leaves, bark, crevices and debris, and consisted of insects, including larvae taken from dead wood, beetles, grasshoppers and ants. Observations suggest the species preferentially foraged on bromeliads (Lees <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is little breeding information, but an immature was collected in January, and birds in February were moulting (Ridgely and Tudor 1994)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. One of the individuals at the Jaqueira (Frei Caneca) Reserve in 2007/2008 was observed in secondary forest (P. Develey <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2008, 2009).  <p></p>","Forest at Murici was reduced from 70 km<sup>2</sup> in the 1970s, to c. 30 km<sup>2</sup> of highly disturbed and fragmented habitat by 1999 (J.

Such forest fragments are severely threatened by fires spreading from adjacent plantations (A. Whittaker <em>in litt</em>. 1999, J. Goerck <em>in litt</em>. 1999, 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The Frei Caneca private reserve and adjacent SAVE Brasil protected area are still suffering from ongoing illegal charcoal exploitation (P. Develey <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2008, 2009). The massive clearance of Atlantic forest in Alagoas and Pernambuco left few other sites of suitable forest remaining.

It was first discovered at Murici (Alagoas) in 1979, when it was described as relatively conspicuous and easy to locate (Teixeira and Gonzaga 1983). Subsequent surveys found the species to be rare, and there were no confirmed records between 1992 and 1998. Single individuals were found in 1998 and 1999 (A. Whittaker <em>in litt</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>, and four birds in 2000 (J. Goerck <em>in litt</em>. 1999, 2000).

During this entire period there are no records alluding to the species, and to this day it is only known from Salisbury's description and a single drawing of a male plant. Its local date of extinction is thus unknown, and can be anywhere from the turn of the 18th century until recently. However, the fact that it was not collected by collectors in the middle 18th century suggests that it was either very rare or extinct in the early 1800s.
